## 📋 Executive Summary
This project was a strategic initiative to mature the **information security posture** of a growing logistics company. Recognizing an evolving threat landscape, I architected a comprehensive **risk assessment program** to identify critical vulnerabilities and build a prioritized mitigation roadmap.

By shifting focus from "checkbox compliance" to a **Business-Centric Risk Methodology**, I provided leadership with a clear strategy to:
* **Protect critical revenue streams** and operational continuity.
* **Safeguard data sovereignty** in a hybrid-cloud environment.
* **Build long-term resilience** against sophisticated threats (Ransomware, BEC).

## 📉 1. The Challenge (Gap Analysis)
The organization relied heavily on **cloud-based systems** for operations but lacked a formalized risk framework. Security was reactive and fragmented.

| **Vulnerability Category** | **Observed Gap** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Governance** | **No Single Source of Truth:** Lack of centralized repository for evaluating risk. |
| **Control Efficacy** | **Ad-Hoc Controls:** Security measures implemented piecemeal without strategic alignment. |
| **Attack Surface** | **Unchecked Growth:** Rapid cloud adoption expanded entry points for adversaries. |
| **Resilience** | **Untested IR:** No formal Incident Response plan for major continuity threats. |

**Objective:** Transform security from a cost center into a **strategic enabler** of business growth.

## 🛠️ 2. Strategic Approach & Methodology
I designed an **end-to-end risk architecture** based on **NIST SP 800-30** and **ISO 27005**, tailored for practical business application.

### 🔹 Phase 1: Asset-Centric Identification
* Conducted workshops with business unit leaders.
* Classified "Crown Jewel" assets: Cloud ERP, Customer Data, Financial Platforms.

### 🔹 Phase 2: Threat Modeling & Mapping
* Mapped high-probability threats (Ransomware, Unauthorized Access) to specific technical vulnerabilities (MFA gaps, Mutable backups).
* Utilized **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** to contextualize risks.

### 🔹 Phase 3: Quantitative & Qualitative Analysis
* Developed a custom **Risk Matrix** incorporating financial, operational, and reputational impact.
* Translated technical risk into "Executive Language" (Impact on Revenue).

## 🚀 3. Key Contributions & Results
Transitioned the organization from a **Reactive** posture to a **Proactive Risk Program**:

* ✅ **Prioritized Roadmap:** Delivered 12 high-impact recommendations, enabling focused resource allocation.
* ✅ **Identity Security:** Rolled out company-wide **MFA (Azure AD)**, drastically reducing BEC risk.
* ✅ **Human Defense:** Launched a **Cybersecurity Awareness Program** with quarterly phishing simulations.
* ✅ **Data Resilience:** Architected **Immutable, Off-site Backups** to neutralize ransomware extortion tactics.
* ✅ **Governance:** Established a **Security Steering Committee** to integrate security into annual planning.

## 💻 4. Technology & Security Stack

### Frameworks & Standards
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
* **NIST SP 800-30** (Risk Assessment)
* **ISO 27005** (Information Security Risk Management)

### Security Architecture & Tooling
| **Domain** | **Technology Stack** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SIEM / Analytics** | Azure Sentinel |
| **Vulnerability Mgmt** | Qualys, Microsoft Defender VM |
| **Endpoint Security** | Sophos Endpoint, Defender for Endpoint (EDR) |
| **Cloud Security (CSPM)** | Microsoft Defender for Cloud |
| **Identity (IAM)** | Azure AD PIM, Conditional Access |
| **Data Protection** | Microsoft Purview (DLP) |

## 🧠 5. Conclusion: The "Architect" Mindset
This project reinforced that effective Information Security is not just about tools—it is about **Systems Thinking**.

* **Communication:** Translating technical debt into business risk is critical for C-Level buy-in.
* **Integration:** Security succeeds when it is "baked in" to business processes, not bolted on.
* **Future Readiness:** This framework laid the foundation for my transition into **Advanced InfoSec Architecture** and **AI-Driven Security Solutions**.
